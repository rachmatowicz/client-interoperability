# This only happens on the first invocation that the client makes with the server; after the first
# invocation, the client uses the same protocol version for all subsequent invocations.
# The handshake protocol version is set when the client writes to the variable protocolVersion
# in the method completed() of the response handler EEInteroperableClientExchange.
